# nnClassify
Command line tool for classifying images

 Toxicology – the branch of science concerned with the nature,
 effects, and detection of poisons – has 
 traditionally relied on expensive mammalian studies.
 However, due to the large number of environmental
 toxins that need testing, less expensive, high 
 throughput alternatives are required. Planaria – a small 
 asexual flatworm – provide an inexpensive and scalable
 solution. The small size of planaria not only makes
 them inexpensive to maintain, but also easy to 
 image with a high-resolution camera. Researchers can
 run many test simultaneously, record the planarias
 reaction, and use computer vision techniques to 
 analyze the results in a cost-effect and timely manner.
 The results of some of these tests can be analyzed
 using traditional computer vision techniques;
 however, many tests involve classifying features of the
 planaria – such as their body shape or eyes – as
 normal or abnormal. Deep convolutional neural
 networks have achieved state of the art results on image
 classification tasks, but they require a large training
 set of images. Researchers do not have the time
 or resources to hand-label sufficient images for this
 technique to be effective. Using transfer-learning, we
 have developed a software platform for researchers to
 quickly classify images with near state-of-the-art
 performance and minimal training data.
